      <p>My qualifications are nothing spectacular. I am a consultant who&rsquo;s focuses are
on the
fortune 200 industry and provides professional services on a select set of
technologies. I have a deep passion for software, specifically, open source
software that I devote many hours too, outside of my 9-5. I have come across
an issue that troubles me amongst senior engineers that I hope to change in
people I get the opportunity to come in contact with. That issue is the
pessimism of Veterans in the field of technologies that they begrudgingly have to
work with.</p>
<h2 id="the-intermediates-perspective">The Intermediates Perspective</h2>
<p>Fresh Computer Science majors are thrown into a world of possibilities. SWE at
FAANG is all that we hope for, but more often than not we work jobs at Insurance
companies, Banking, or Consultancies as a gun for hire. In these roles we typically don&rsquo;t
develop something entirely new. We are software plumbers. Pump data from one
place to another. Do some analysis and/or transform that data to be sent to another
software&rsquo;s API to be consumed, used and displayed. The majority of the world is
a black box only for seniors to touch. Though the plumbing is often unique and
necessary, it pales to the effort of architecting and building the two
technologies we are connecting. In our minds, we could build prototypes of these
technologies, but encompassing the vast scope and depth of some of these projects
are out of reach and not something we feel could ever be warranted in our roles.</p>
<p>I love the company that I work for and have a few seniors that I admire for
their mastery in a domain of knowledge. They often spout information that I can
follow and understand but wouldn&rsquo;t come to as my first mode of thought. I rely
on them as a Easy Button so to speak. Instead of using Gipty (Chat GPT) as a
source of truth, I can talk and work with someone who has domain expertise on
something I do not, to give me good first steps on a problem I&rsquo;m required to
solve. This is fantastic and it feels as if I&rsquo;m speed running years of hard
fought knowledge they had to gain. But I felt something shift in me. The
questions became less of how can I solve this problem to why is XYZ company
so silly not to implement it this way from the start.</p>
<h2 id="senior-engineer-brain-rot">Senior Engineer Brain Rot</h2>
<p>The title of this section is tongue in cheek, but I do believe an existence in
a world that contains libraries of millions of lines of code, available for free,
rots the brains of people who use these technologies. Every generation stands on
the shoulders of giants. I like to think of projects like Chris Sawyers
RollerCoaster Typhoon that was written in assembly (there were advances well
beyond this point but it was something I heard early on my career that inspired
me). Even this project stood on the shoulders of giants who created LED&rsquo;s,
Vacuum tubes and hell even the furnace that began smelting these sorts of
materials. Even as a &ldquo;low level&rdquo; assembly project, it stood on years of precedent
and research.</p>
<p>I often hear comments on specific mew technologies that have been a pain to
implement. There will be comments such as &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they did it this
way&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t the do it this way&rdquo;, &ldquo;If they just did it this way it would
make the whole process so much easier&rdquo;, &ldquo;If the software wasn&rsquo;t so stupid it
could just do&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re too dumb to&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I believe the best and most popular projects like Linux distorted the view of
what software &ldquo;should&rdquo; be. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that we hold our selves to a lower
standard but I am suggesting that tools that are purpose built remain just that,
purpose built. Some tools are not made for us plumbers; who have 3 month
contracts to fulfill for some order of work. Some tools are hard and they are hard
for a reason. Because the problems they attempt to solve are even harder.</p>
<p>Open source software consumerism damages our expectations. You go to McDonald&rsquo;s,
and you have a dairy allergy. You order no Cheese. Sometimes you get cheese, but
most of the time you don&rsquo;t. McDonald&rsquo;s does this for every item and combination
on their menu. Be it onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato you name it. Software
attempts to do the same thing, but just like McDonalds it is simply impossible to
get it right for every circumstance because humans are imperfect. I suggest that
we shift our mindset from a place of software consumerism, to a place of
understanding and appreciation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a simple intermediate, all I can do is be in awe that any of this works at
all. I have so much passion about good software because of its ability to help
me meet my goals and learn. I even have passion for intermediate software
because it strives and attempts to do the same. All in all,
most open source software attempts comes from a place of learning, giving, and
occasionally excellence.</p>
